Hi, I blog about programming with a focus on machine learning. I will try to explain things as clear as I can, while giving insights to the concepts I am presenting. To keep the blog succinct, I will refrain from using elaborate examples (including code samples). I will try to offer some thoughts for things I find confusing while learning the concepts. By the end of the post, I hope the reader will have a clear picture of the data flow of the algorithm and why it works the way it does, and possibly some ideas on how it could be improved. As a learner, I hope this blog offers some useful analysis and inspirations.
