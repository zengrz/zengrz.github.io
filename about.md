Hi. I blog about programming with a focus on machine learning. To keep the blog succinct, I will refrain from using elaborate examples (including code samples, equations). With that said, I will try to offer some insights for things I find confusing when learning about the concept in my posts. By the end of the post, I hope the reader will have a rough picture of the data flow of the algorithm. As a learner, I hope this blog offers some insights and inspirations.
